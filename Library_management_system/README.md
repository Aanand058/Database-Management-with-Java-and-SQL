# Library Management System

## About the Project

### Introduction
In today’s fast-paced digital world, effective data management is essential, especially in systems like libraries where administrators need to access, update, and manage large book collections efficiently. This project is a **Library Management System** designed to simplify the management of book records by leveraging a MySQL database and JavaFX for the user interface.

You will implement key functionalities including retrieving, inserting, searching, updating, and deleting book data. This system aims to provide a smooth, intuitive experience for managing library resources while ensuring data integrity and seamless interaction between the GUI and backend database.

---

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build a comprehensive Library Management System that enables library administrators to manage book records efficiently. The system supports core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, advanced search and sorting features, and maintains relational consistency between books, borrowers, and loan records.

By integrating JavaFX for the GUI and MySQL via JDBC for the database backend, this project offers practical experience in designing and implementing user-driven software with real-world applicability.

## Project Goals
By the end of this project, you will have developed a system that:

- **Retrieves** book data from a MySQL database and displays it in a JavaFX TableView.
- **Inserts** new book records with real-time update of displayed data.
- **Searches** for books using keywords to easily locate specific titles.
- **Updates** existing book information.
- **Deletes** book entries to keep the database current.
- **Sorts** book records by various attributes like title or author.
- Maintains **data integrity** between books, borrowers, and loans.
- Provides a **user-friendly interface** for smooth interactions using JavaFX.

## What to Expect

This project involves:

- **Database Interaction:** Using SQL and JDBC to connect and manipulate the MySQL database.
- **GUI Development:** Building a JavaFX graphical interface to display and manage book data.
- **File I/O Operations:** Handling data flow between the application and the database.
- **Sorting and Searching:** Implementing algorithms for efficient data retrieval and organization.

## Grading Criteria (If applicable)

Your work will be evaluated on:

- **Database Setup and Connection**
  - Proper creation and configuration of `LibraryDB` with tables for books, borrowers, and loans.
  - Successful connection of the Java application to MySQL using JDBC.

- **JavaFX GUI Implementation**
  - Design of an intuitive and responsive user interface.
  - Effective display and management of book records.

- **CRUD Operations**
  - Correct implementation of Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities integrated with the GUI and backed by SQL queries.

- **Search and Sort Features**
  - Functionality to search books by title and sort data by attributes like title and author.

- **Error Handling and Data Validation**
  - Robust exception handling and validation to maintain data integrity and prevent crashes.

- **Code Quality**
  - Clean, well-structured, and commented code following best practices.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** – Programming language for the application logic.
- **JavaFX** – For building the graphical user interface.
- **MySQL** – Database system to store library records.
- **JDBC** – To connect Java with MySQL database.
- **Scene Builder** (optional) – For designing JavaFX UI layouts visually.

---

## Conclusion

This project will equip you with hands-on experience in building a full-featured Library Management System that integrates GUI development with database management and CRUD operations. It reinforces key software development concepts such as data handling, user interaction, and backend connectivity.

Successfully completing this project will provide valuable skills for real-world application development and lay a solid foundation for future software engineering endeavors.
