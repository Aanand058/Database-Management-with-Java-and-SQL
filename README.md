# Database-Management-with-Java-and-SQL

## Module 1
This module lays the foundation for understanding and working with databases. It covers the fundamentals of database systems, including table structures, data types, and relationships. You'll learn essential SQL skills for querying and manipulating data, starting with basic filters and progressing to more complex operations like sorting and aggregating. The module then explores various join techniques, teaching you how to combine information from multiple tables effectively. Through a mix of theoretical concepts and hands-on activities, you'll gain practical experience in database creation, querying, and data retrieval. By the end of this module, you'll have a solid grasp of basic database principles and SQL operations, preparing you for more advanced database concepts later in the course.
Learning Objectives
Demonstrate various join techniques to effectively combine data from multiple tables.
Create and manage databases through practical experience in querying and data retrieval, preparing for more advanced concepts.
Apply essential SQL skills to query and manipulate data using filters, sorting, and aggregation techniques.
Understand the fundamental concepts of database systems, including table structures, data types, and relationships.


## Module 2
In this module, you'll explore how to connect Java applications with databases using JDBC, starting with the basics of JDBC architecture and how to make your first database connection from Java. You'll learn how set up your environment, load drivers, and establish connections. You'll also dive into connection management, covering handy techniques like using DataSource and taking care of connection lifecycles. As you progress, you'll also explore working with Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML)—learning how to create, modify, and drop tables, and handle transactions like a pro. Through interactive activities and practical exercises, you'll build the skills needed to write Java code that smoothly interacts with databases, setting you up to create strong, database-powered applications.
Learning Objectives
Implement error-handling strategies to manage exceptions and ensure the stability of database connections within Java applications.
Apply Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) skills to create, alter, and drop tables, and manage transactions within Java applications.
Implement connection management techniques using DataSource and properly handle connection lifecycles.
Set up the Java environment for database integration, including loading drivers and establishing connections.
Understand the JDBC architecture and the fundamentals of database connectivity from Java.


## Module 3
In this module, you'll dive into building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for database apps using JavaFX. You'll start by setting up projects and creating basic GUIs, getting hands-on with event handling. Then, you'll connect your JavaFX apps to databases, learning how to fetch and display data smoothly. You'll also tackle error handling for database operations. As you progress, you'll explore advanced UI techniques like using SceneBuilder for design, data binding, and adding features like search. By the end, you'll confidently create interactive, database-powered Java applications.
Learning Objectives
Design advanced user interfaces using SceneBuilder and data binding to implement complex functionalities such as search features for intuitive, database-driven applications.
Apply error-handling techniques specific to database operations within JavaFX applications.
Connect JavaFX applications to databases and retrieve and display data within the user interface.
Demonstrate proficiency in JavaFX fundamentals, including project setup, event handling, and creating simple graphical user interfaces.


## Module 4 
In this final module, you'll bring everything together from the course to build a Library Management System as your capstone project. You’ll get hands-on experience integrating database design, SQL, Java programming, and JavaFX to create a complete application. Along the way, you'll reflect on your learning through a self-assessment and a final quiz, helping reinforce key concepts. You’ll also look ahead to explore potential next steps in your database management and Java programming journey, setting the stage for future growth.
