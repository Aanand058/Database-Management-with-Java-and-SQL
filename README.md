# Database Management with Java and SQL

This project provides a comprehensive guide to building database-driven applications using Java, SQL, and JavaFX. It covers fundamental concepts, practical database operations, and GUI integration through a hands-on approach.

## Overview

This repository brings together key components of working with databases using Java:
- Understanding database fundamentals and SQL operations
- Integrating Java applications with relational databases using JDBC
- Creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using JavaFX
- Developing a capstone project (Library Management System)

Whether you're starting out with databases or looking to build full-fledged Java applications with a backend, this project walks you through each essential step.

## Key Concepts & Skills

- **Database Design & SQL**
  - Table structures, data types, and relationships
  - Writing and executing SQL queries with filtering, sorting, and aggregation
  - Using joins to combine data from multiple tables

- **JDBC Integration**
  - JDBC architecture and driver setup
  - Connecting Java to databases using JDBC and DataSource
  - Performing CRUD operations with SQL (DDL & DML)
  - Managing transactions and error handling in Java

- **JavaFX for GUI Applications**
  - JavaFX project setup and event handling
  - Connecting GUIs to databases for live data interaction
  - SceneBuilder, data binding, and advanced UI features like search
  - Exception handling for user-friendly experiences

- **Capstone Project: Library Management System**
  - End-to-end development of a real-world Java application
  - Database schema design, backend logic, and GUI integration
  - Combines all previously learned concepts in a practical build

## Learning Outcomes

- Apply SQL and relational database principles effectively
- Build robust Java applications that interact with databases
- Create responsive and user-friendly GUIs using JavaFX
- Gain hands-on experience with full-stack development in Java

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Java programming
