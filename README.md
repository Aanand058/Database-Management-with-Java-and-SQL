# Database-Management-with-Java-and-SQL

## Module 1
This module lays the foundation for understanding and working with databases. It covers the fundamentals of database systems, including table structures, data types, and relationships. You'll learn essential SQL skills for querying and manipulating data, starting with basic filters and progressing to more complex operations like sorting and aggregating. The module then explores various join techniques, teaching you how to combine information from multiple tables effectively. Through a mix of theoretical concepts and hands-on activities, you'll gain practical experience in database creation, querying, and data retrieval. By the end of this module, you'll have a solid grasp of basic database principles and SQL operations, preparing you for more advanced database concepts later in the course.
